# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project
A school district asked for a snapshot of several key metrics by each school campus and by the district level. The main analysis focused on the performance of math and reading scores disaggregated several ways in preparation for a board meeting. However, after the school board reviewed the data, it was determined that the data from Thomas High School's 9th grade class was suspect of cheating. The school board asked for the data to be removed and analyzed again for a comparison.

# Analysis

### How is the distric summary affected?
When comparing the original analysis with the summary post removing the Thomas High 9th graders there was not much of a difference. The total number of students remained the same do to the grades of the Thomas High students were the only things dropped. The student count and budget remained the same. When looking at the grades after removing the student, the scores dropped about 1% whhich isnt a big difference since the rounded number will still be the same.
